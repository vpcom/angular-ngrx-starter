# Angular NgRx Starter

*In Progress*

This project is an Angular starter application following the redux pattern and using NgRx's Actions, Effects and Entities in order to have a neat scalable app working like a state machine.

## Technical notes

Angular 8

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
